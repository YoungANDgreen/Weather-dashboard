# Weather-dashboard

Intent: 
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

Lessons: 
1. Dynamically generated HTML elements are a great way to present a simple UI for the user while guiding their experience towards the function of the page.
2. APIs are a great way to build complex web applications quickly.

Future development:
1. More appealing style to page using tools like bootstrap.
